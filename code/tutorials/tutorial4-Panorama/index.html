   <h2>Panorama as reality (background)</h2>
    <p>This example illustrate the use of a panorama as an Argon reality. The panorama appears in the background instead of the video from the camera. The panorama can be in one of two forms: it can be a single equirectangular png or jpg, 2. it can six square png or jpg panels making up a "skybox. Both types are defined in the code, but the skybox is the one that is actually displayed.This line of code sets the panorama: <br><br> panoramaReality.setPanorama(woodruffPano)<br>
   <br>In this case the panoarama is set to woodruffPano, which is skybox type. You can alter the code to use the other type by changing the line to:<br>
    <br>panoramaReality.setPanorama(pano)
    </P>
